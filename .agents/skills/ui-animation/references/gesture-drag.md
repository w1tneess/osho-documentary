## Momentum-based dismissal

Don't require dragging past a distance threshold; compute velocity at release so a quick flick dismisses.

```ts
function onPointerUp(e: PointerEvent) {
  const timeTaken = Date.now() - dragStartTime;
  const velocity = Math.abs(swipeAmount) / timeTaken;

  if (Math.abs(swipeAmount) >= SWIPE_THRESHOLD || velocity > 0.11) {
    dismiss();
  } else {
    snapBack();
  }
}
```

Default threshold: velocity > 0.11. Combine with a minimum distance (e.g. 20px) to prevent accidental dismissals.

## Velocity handoff

When a gesture ends, the animation must continue at the finger's exact velocity so there is no visible seam between dragging and animating. This is the detail that most separates "fluid" from "fine". Pass the pointer's release velocity as the spring's initial velocity.

Motion and Framer Motion take absolute px/s velocity directly via the `velocity` option, so hand them the raw release velocity:

```ts
// releaseVelocity in px/s, measured over the last few pointermove events
animate(el, { y: target }, { type: "spring", velocity: releaseVelocity, bounce: 0, duration: 0.4 });
```

Some spring APIs want relative velocity: normalize by the remaining distance to the target.

```ts
const relativeVelocity = gestureVelocity / (targetValue - currentValue);
// element at y=50, target y=150 (100px to go), finger at 50px/s -> 50 / 100 = 0.5
```

To have velocity ready at release, track a short position and timestamp history (last few `pointermove` events), not just the current point.

## Momentum projection

Don't snap to the nearest boundary from the release point. Use velocity to project where the gesture is heading, then snap to the target nearest that projected point. This is what makes a flick feel like it throws the element, exactly like scroll deceleration. Good bottom sheets and carousels (Vaul, Embla) work this way.

```ts
// decelerationRate ~ 0.998 for a normal scroll feel; 0.99 for snappier
function project(initialVelocity: number, decelerationRate = 0.998): number {
  return (initialVelocity / 1000) * decelerationRate / (1 - decelerationRate);
}

const projectedEndpoint = currentPosition + project(releaseVelocity);
const target = nearestSnapPoint(projectedEndpoint); // choose target from the projection
animateSpringTo(target, { velocity: releaseVelocity }); // then hand off velocity (previous section)
```

Use this exponential-decay form, not the physics-textbook `v^2 / (2 * decel)`; the decay form is what Apple ships in the *Designing Fluid Interfaces* sample code.

## Boundary damping

Past the natural boundary (e.g. pulling a drawer up when already at top), apply damping: the more they drag, the less it moves.

```ts
function applyDamping(offset: number, max: number): number {
  return max * (1 - Math.exp(-offset / max));
}

// Usage: as offset grows, movement diminishes
const dampedOffset = applyDamping(rawOffset, 200);
```

Apple's canonical rubber-band function (from *Designing Fluid Interfaces*) is a good drop-in alternative, tuned to feel like iOS overscroll:

```ts
// the further past the bound, the less the element follows
function rubberband(overshoot: number, dimension: number, constant = 0.55): number {
  return (overshoot * dimension * constant) / (dimension + constant * Math.abs(overshoot));
}
```

Real things slow before stopping; friction beats hard stops.

## Pointer capture

On drag start, capture all pointer events so the drag continues even if the pointer leaves the element.

```ts
function onPointerDown(e: PointerEvent) {
  (e.target as HTMLElement).setPointerCapture(e.pointerId);
  isDragging = true;
}

function onPointerUp(e: PointerEvent) {
  (e.target as HTMLElement).releasePointerCapture(e.pointerId);
  isDragging = false;
}
```

Always use `setPointerCapture`; without it, fast swipes escape the element and the drag breaks.

## Grab offset

Record where inside the element the pointer landed, and hold that offset for the whole drag:

```ts
let grabY = 0;

function onPointerDown(e: PointerEvent) {
  const r = el.getBoundingClientRect();
  grabY = e.clientY - r.top; // where in the element the finger actually is
}

function onPointerMove(e: PointerEvent) {
  setY(e.clientY - grabY); // not e.clientY, and not a centred element
}
```

Positioning from `e.clientY` alone snaps the element's top (or its centre, with a `-50%` translate) to the pointer the instant the drag begins. The element jumps under the finger before it has moved, which breaks 1:1 tracking at the only moment the user is watching for it. Grab a sheet by its handle and it should stay gripped by the handle.

## Axis commitment

Track from `pointerdown`, but do not claim an axis until the pointer has travelled about 10px:

```ts
let axis: "x" | "y" | null = null;

function onPointerMove(e: PointerEvent) {
  const dx = e.clientX - startX;
  const dy = e.clientY - startY;

  if (!axis) {
    if (Math.hypot(dx, dy) < 10) return; // too early to tell
    axis = Math.abs(dx) > Math.abs(dy) ? "x" : "y";
  }
  if (axis !== "x") return; // this handler owns horizontal only
  // drag...
}
```

Deciding on the first `pointermove` reads noise: the first few pixels of a vertical scroll usually carry some horizontal drift, so a swipe-to-dismiss row inside a scrolling list steals the gesture and the list stops scrolling. Once committed, hold the axis until `pointerup`; re-deciding mid-drag makes the element stutter between behaviours.

This is the custom-handler counterpart to the declarative fix under Carousel axis. `touch-action` tells the browser which axis it may keep, which settles native scrolling; it does nothing for a handler resolving the ambiguity itself.

## Multi-touch protection

Ignore extra touch points after the drag begins; without this, switching fingers mid-drag makes the element jump.

```ts
let activeTouchId: number | null = null;

function onPointerDown(e: PointerEvent) {
  if (activeTouchId !== null) return; // Ignore additional touches
  activeTouchId = e.pointerId;
  // Start drag...
}

function onPointerUp(e: PointerEvent) {
  if (e.pointerId !== activeTouchId) return;
  activeTouchId = null;
  // End drag...
}
```

## Friction vs hard stops

Allow drag past a boundary, with increasing friction:

```ts
function applyFriction(delta: number, isAtBoundary: boolean): number {
  if (!isAtBoundary) return delta;
  return delta * 0.3; // 30% of movement at boundary
}
```

Hard stops feel broken; users expect physics. Apply friction for scroll containers, sliders, and drawers.

## Rotary drag

For knobs and dials, track the *angle* from the control's centre, not the pointer delta. Reading `dx`/`dy` makes the knob respond to how far the pointer moved rather than where it moved to, so the grip slides off the moment the user circles wide.

The trap is the wrap at ±180°. `atan2` jumps from `π` to `-π` in one frame, and an unguarded subtraction sends the value flying a full turn. Normalise every delta into `(-π, π]` before accumulating:

```ts
const TWO_PI = Math.PI * 2;

function angleFrom(el: HTMLElement, e: PointerEvent): number {
  const r = el.getBoundingClientRect();
  return Math.atan2(e.clientY - (r.top + r.height / 2), e.clientX - (r.left + r.width / 2));
}

let last = 0;
let turns = 0; // accumulated rotation in radians, unbounded

function onPointerDown(e: PointerEvent) {
  el.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId); // see Pointer capture
  last = angleFrom(el, e);
}

function onPointerMove(e: PointerEvent) {
  const now = angleFrom(el, e);
  // Shortest way round, so the ±180 seam never registers as a full turn.
  const delta = ((now - last + Math.PI * 3) % TWO_PI) - Math.PI;
  turns += delta;
  last = now;
  setValue(clamp(turns / TWO_PI));
}
```

Two things fall out of this. A knob with a limited range (a volume dial, not an endless encoder) needs the *accumulated* value clamped, never the per-frame angle, or the knob detaches from the pointer at the limit and jumps back when the user reverses. And a knob whose travel is under one full turn should apply Boundary damping at each end, exactly as a linear slider does.

## Detents and snapping

A ruler picker, tick slider, or segment scrubber has discrete stops. Do not snap during the drag: the value should follow the pointer continuously, and settle to the nearest detent only on release. Snapping live makes the control feel like it is fighting the finger.

```ts
function onRelease(value: number, velocity: number) {
  // Project where momentum would carry it, then snap that (see Momentum projection).
  const projected = value + velocity * 0.15;
  const target = Math.round(projected / STEP) * STEP;
  animate(value, target, { type: "spring", stiffness: 500, damping: 40 });
}
```

Snapping the *projected* landing point rather than the release position is what makes a flick feel like it threw the control several notches, instead of dropping it at the nearest tick.

The tick marks themselves carry the feedback during the drag. Scale or darken the tick under the indicator as it passes, on `transform` and `color` only. This is the visual stand-in for the haptic click a physical detent would give, and without it a continuous drag over a ruler reads as a smooth slider that happens to be drawn with lines. On a device that supports it, pair the passing tick with `navigator.vibrate(1)`.

## Swipe-to-dismiss pattern

Velocity decides; distance is only the tie-breaker. Sign both against the dismissal direction, so "toward dismissal" is positive on each.

```ts
const FLICK = 0.11; // px/ms, matches Sonner

// offset and velocity are both signed along the drag axis:
// positive = moving toward dismissal, negative = back toward rest.
function handleSwipeEnd(offset: number, velocity: number) {
  if (Math.abs(velocity) > FLICK) {
    // A flick decides on its own, in whichever direction it points.
    if (velocity > 0) animateOut(velocity);
    else springBack(velocity);
    return;
  }
  // Released slowly: position is all the intent there is.
  if (offset > THRESHOLD) animateOut(velocity);
  else springBack(velocity);
}
```

The common bug is `distance > THRESHOLD || velocity > 0.11` against an unsigned velocity. A sheet dragged 80% closed and then flicked back toward open passes the distance test and dismisses anyway, which is the user's cancel gesture doing the opposite of what they asked. Checking magnitude first and sign second is what makes a reversal cancel.

The exit continues in the swipe direction with momentum; snapping elsewhere feels wrong. Feed `velocity` into the exit spring's `velocity` option so drag and animation share no seam, and into `springBack` too: a cancelled flick that starts from zero reads as a bounce the user did not cause.

## Carousel axis

A horizontal scroller that also moves the page is an axis fight.

**CSS `overflow-x` / scroll-snap:** let the browser pan horizontally, and stop horizontal overscroll from triggering Back:

```css
.carousel {
  overflow-x: auto;
  touch-action: pan-x;
  overscroll-behavior-x: contain;
}
```

**JS-driven** (Embla, Swiper, Keen): those libraries set `touch-action: pan-y` so the page still scrolls vertically while they handle the horizontal drag. Do not override to `pan-x`.
